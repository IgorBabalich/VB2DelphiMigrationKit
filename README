Introduction
============

VB2Delphi Migration Kit is a Visual Basic 6 to Delphi source code conversion tool.

to Delphi equivalents. See help/maps.htm.

Compiling
=========

The source code was written in Delphi 7. 
To compile, you need the following libraries:

  - DelphiCollections at http://www.warmachine.u-net.com/delphi_collections/
  - JEDI Code Library at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/
  - FastMM4 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm/

The GenVB2D tool uses TLBINF32.DLL at runtime.
This is a higher-level COM interface to get type library information.
